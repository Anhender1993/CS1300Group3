# CS1300Group3
this is the final test for the Atlas School class CS1300, group 3
Ari, Casey, and Andrew

Ari was initially responsible for the following files: hiring_page.html, and order_page.html, but unfortunately, she fell sick and needed assistance with her pages

Casey was responsible for the following files: main.js, contact.html, and the API.  Being unable to find an API, Casey partnered with Andrew to look into additional options.

Andrew was responsible for creating the repository, index.html, nutritional.html, and styles.css and assisted Casey with finding an applicable API, as well as picking up where Ari had left off due to her illness, which put them past the commit deadline--but submission will occur shortly.
